## Problem Statement

The candidates will be provided with a market data stream over TCP/IP which will contain the market data structure as given below. Your goal is to process the market data and calculate Implied volatility (IV), etc. and display as an options chain screen (e.g. https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain ) as a webpage. The following points should be catered.

- Highlight the "in the money" options and "out of money" options differently as shown in above example.

- There must be a selection of underlying and different expiries.

- The options chain should work in real-time. As the market data changes, the fields should be recalculated and refreshed on screen without having to reload on the browser.

For Implied Volatility (IV) calculation, you can assume the following:

- Use Black Scholes Formula for calculating IV from options price.
- Risk free interest rate as 5%
- To calculate Time To maturity (TTM) accurately, you can assume the expiry time to be at 15:30 IST on the expiry day. As soon as the contract expires, TTM will be negative implying IV as 0.

An option being a derivative of an underlying, you will need an underlying price which will also be published in the same market data stream.
